# BISINDO-SLR-YOLOViT

This is repo for my final project which is BISINDO Sign Language Recognition using YOLO-Pose and Visual Transformer.
Im a complete beginner, so the code, data structure, etc might be fckd up. Forgive my noobie skill on Machine Learning

## Dataset

I use smaller HaGridV2 because the original is too big for my device, then extracted just 1000 data from each class
